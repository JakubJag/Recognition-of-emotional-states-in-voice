## **Recognition of Emotional States in Voice**
This project analyzes human voice to determine emotional states using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide an effective solution for emotion recognition based on acoustic features, offering better results compared to alternative methods

## **Introduction**
The project uses machine learning techniques, such as SVM and Random Forest, to classify emotions based on MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of classification model performance
